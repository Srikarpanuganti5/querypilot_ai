# Progress

## Day 1 — repository foundation

Status: complete and validated. Historical Day 1 results are retained below.

The earlier pass exceeded Day 1. Its API, database/LLM tools, frontend, Docker, CI,
seed/evaluation scripts, advanced tests, and operational documentation have been removed
from this working tree to match the requested scope.

At Day 1 completion: src-layout package boundaries, development configuration, environment template,
ignore rules, goals, roadmap, architecture, contributor instructions, README, synthetic
sample-data directory, and one import smoke test. There are no runtime dependencies.

## Validation

Verification used Python 3.12.15. Commands below ran from the repository root unless
otherwise stated. No PostgreSQL, OpenAI, or other application service was contacted.

| Command/check | Actual result |
| --- | --- |
| `git status --short` during initial inspection | Failed: directory is not a Git repository. No commit or push was attempted. |
| `.venv/bin/python -m pip --version` | Failed: existing uv-created environment has no pip module. Used uv instead. |
| Offline `uv sync --python 3.12 --extra dev` (full command below) | Exit 0; resolved 8 packages, rebuilt editable package, removed 58 unused later-milestone packages. |
| `.venv/bin/python --version` | Exit 0; Python 3.12.15. |
| `.venv/bin/python -c "import querypilot; print(querypilot.__name__); print(querypilot.__file__)"` | Exit 0; imported `querypilot` from this workspace's `src/querypilot/__init__.py`. |
| `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q` | Exit 0; 1 passed in 0.00s. |
| `.venv/bin/ruff check .` | Exit 0; all checks passed. |
| `.venv/bin/ruff format --check .` | Exit 0; reported 17 files already formatted. |
| Python directory/scope assertions and tree printer | Exit 0; required directories exist, runtime dependencies are empty, exactly one test exists, source files are package initializers only, Docker/Compose/CI files are absent. |
| Offline `uv lock --check` using the same temporary executable/cache as below | Exit 0; lockfile is current, resolved 8 packages. |
| Installed package metadata inspection | Exit 0; querypilot-ai 0.1.0, Pytest 9.1.1, Ruff 0.17.2. |

The existing temporary uv installation and cached Python/dependencies allowed installation
without network access. The exact synchronization command was:

```sh
UV_PYTHON_INSTALL_DIR=/private/tmp/querypilot-python /private/tmp/querypilot-bootstrap/bin/uv sync --python 3.12 --extra dev --offline --cache-dir /private/tmp/querypilot-uv-cache
```

Normal setup commands using pip or uv are in README.md. No unresolved Day 1 blocker.
The initial Day 1 task did not initialize Git or make commits. In a follow-up request,
the user authorized committing and pushing completed daily milestones. Git is now
initialized on `main`, and that ongoing preference is recorded in AGENTS.md.

## Day 2 — FastAPI backend foundation (2026-10-26)

Status: implemented and verified. The user has explicitly approved the Day 2 commit
and push in a follow-up request. No Day 3 implementation has begun.

### Accomplishments and files

- Added `src/querypilot/main.py`: application factory, metadata, lifespan, composition.
- Added `api/router.py` and `api/routes/{health,info}.py`: `/health` and `/api/v1/info`.
- Added `core/config.py`: typed environment settings and exact-origin validation.
- Added `core/logging.py` and `api/middleware.py`: JSON logs, request IDs, safe failures.
- Added `api/errors.py` and `schemas/system.py`: consistent typed JSON application errors.
- Added `tests/test_api.py` and `tests/test_config.py`; retained the Day 1 smoke test unchanged.
- Updated `pyproject.toml`/`uv.lock` with runtime FastAPI, Pydantic, Pydantic Settings,
  Uvicorn, and development-only HTTPX. Their purposes are explained in README.md.
- Updated `.env.example`, README.md, AGENTS.md, GOALS.md, PLANS.md, architecture/progress,
  and the package docstrings for the implemented layers.

### Commands and actual results

Commands used Python 3.12.15 and the existing virtual environment. No database, API key,
or external application service was needed.

| Command/check | Actual result |
| --- | --- |
| Offline uv sync using the Day 1 temporary executable/cache | Exit 0; resolved 27 packages, installed 20, rebuilt editable package. |
| Initial `ruff check . --fix` | Failed on one long line; formatting fixed it. |
| `ruff format .` then `ruff check .` | Exit 0; 6 files reformatted, lint passed. |
| Initial pytest run | 23 passed; then added wildcard-host CORS validation coverage. |
| `.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q` (final run) | 24 passed, 1 dependency deprecation warning in 0.19s. |
| `.venv/bin/ruff format --check .` | Exit 0; 28 files already formatted at that point. |
| Uvicorn reload start on 127.0.0.1:8765, sandboxed | Failed: operation not permitted. |
| Same Uvicorn command with approved sandbox escalation | Started reload and server processes; application startup complete. |
| HTTPX requests to loopback, sandboxed | Failed: operation not permitted. |
| Same HTTP checks with approved sandbox escalation | Health/info/docs/redoc/OpenAPI all returned 200; unknown route returned JSON 404. |
| Ctrl-C to verification server | Clean shutdown; application/server/reloader stopped. |
| Final `.venv/bin/ruff check .` and `.venv/bin/ruff format --check .` | Exit 0; all checks passed, 28 files already formatted. |
| Package and app import check | Exit 0; `QueryPilot AI 0.1.0`. |
| Offline `uv lock --check` with the existing temporary executable/cache | Exit 0; resolved 27 packages, lockfile current. |
| `git diff --check` | Exit 0; no whitespace errors. |
| Tracked/pending file inspection | `.env` and `.venv` excluded; only `.env.example` present; no recognized OpenAI/GitHub key or private-key patterns found. This is a targeted check, not an exhaustive secret audit. |
| `git diff -- tests/test_smoke.py` | Empty; Day 1 smoke test unchanged. |

Server command actually run:

```sh
.venv/bin/uvicorn querypilot.main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8765
```

Live HTTP output:

```text
GET /health: 200 application/json
{'status': 'healthy', 'service': 'querypilot-ai', 'version': '0.1.0'}
GET /api/v1/info: 200 application/json
{'name': 'QueryPilot AI', 'version': '0.1.0', 'description': 'Tool-Using LLM Agent API'}
GET /docs: 200 text/html; charset=utf-8
GET /redoc: 200 text/html; charset=utf-8
GET /openapi.json: 200 application/json
GET /unknown: 404 application/json
Live HTTP checks: PASS
```

The tests cover metadata, documentation, OpenAPI, 404/405/422/500 errors, sanitized
HTTP exception details and logs, CORS allow/deny/preflight/defaults, settings precedence,
invalid origins/log levels, and the original package import test.

### Problems and practical limits

Local socket operations required sandbox approval, after which startup and HTTP checks
passed. FastAPI/Starlette TestClient emits an upstream deprecation warning for HTTPX;
tests pass and HTTPX remains the test transport requested for this milestone. Browser
rendering and CDN asset downloads were not tested; documentation HTML and schema were.
Application error envelopes exclude raw inputs and internal details; built-in CORS
preflight responses retain their standard framework format. No unresolved functional blocker.

### Day 3 preparation

After a separate request: PostgreSQL schema constraints, a reproducible publicly shareable
synthetic e-commerce dataset, and separate setup/reader credentials. No database, seed,
chat, LLM, agent-tool, Docker, or CI implementation is included in Day 2.
